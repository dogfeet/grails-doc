To install from a URL simply specify the absolute URL to the plug-in package:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin http://foo.com/grails-bar-1.0.zip
{code}

To install from a local file specify the absolute or relative path to the file:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin ../grails-bar-1.0.zip
{code}

You can also install plug-ins provided via the remote central repository. To find out what plug-ins are available use [list-plugins|commandLine]

If you want to install a plug-in. Say the "jsecurity" plug-in you can use the install-plugin command followed by the plugin name:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin jsecurity
{code}

This will install the latest version of the plug-in. If you need to install a specific version you can use:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin jsecurity 0.1
{code}
