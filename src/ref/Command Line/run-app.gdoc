h2. Purpose

Runs Grails uses an embedded "Jetty":http://www.mortbay.org/ container on port @8080@

h2. Examples

{code:java}
grails run-app
grails test run-app
grails -Dserver.port=8090 -Denable.jndi=true -Ddisable.auto.recompile=true run-app
{code}

h2. Description

Usage: 
{code:java}
grails [env]* run-app
{code}

Arguments:

* @disable.auto.recompile@ - Disables auto-recompilation of Java sources, which can be processor intensive (defaults to false)
* @recompile.frequency@ - Specifies how frequently (in seconds) Grails checks for changes to Java and Groovy sources in your project (defaults to 3).
* @server.port@ - Specifies the port to run the server on (defaults to 8080)
* @server.host@ - Specifies the host name to run the server on (defaults to localhost)
* @enable.jndi@ - Specifies whether Jetty should run with the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) enabled

Fired Events:

* @StatusFinal@ - When the container has been started
* @StatusUpdate@ - When the container is reloading

This command will start Grails up in an embedded Jetty Container that can serve HTTP requests. This target is not intended for deployment as the container in development mode is configured to auto-reload changes at runtime which has an overhead attached to it and will not scale well.
