h1. bootstrap 

h2. Purpose

The [bootstrap|commandLine] command is mainly intended to be used by other scripts and enables the ability to bootstrap a Grails application instance outside of the container for usage in tools that require a reference to Grails' ApplicationContext 

Examples of its usage include Grails' [shell|commandLine] and [console|commandLine]

h2. Examples

When used as an include you need to supply the following at the top of your Gant script:

{code:java}
includeTargets << new File ( "${grailsHome}/scripts/Bootstrap.groovy" )
{code}

Once this is in place you can bootstrap Grails using two distinct methods:

* @loadApp@ - Loads and creates the GrailsApplication instance
* @configureApp@ - Loads all the Grails plug-ins and creates the Spring ApplicationContext

The @loadApp@ command will create a @grailsApp@ variable which you can the evaluate:

{code:java}                                                                            
loadApp()
grailsApp.allClasses.each { println it }
{code}

The @configureApp@ command will create @pluginManager@ and @appCtx@ variables representing the [GrailsPluginManager|api:org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugins.GrailsPluginManager] instance and the Spring @ApplicationContext@

{code:java}
configureApp()
Connection c = appCtx.getBean('dataSource').getConnection()
// do something with connection
{code}

Usage: 
{code:java}
