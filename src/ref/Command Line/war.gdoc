The @war@ command will create a web application archive (WAR) file using the application name and version number. By default a war file deployable to the production environment will be created, but the environment can be specified using Grails standard convention:

{code:java}
grails test war
grails dev war
grails prod war
grails war /foo/bar/mywar.war
{code}

You can also specify a custom environment:

{code:java}
grails -Dgrails.env=UAT war
{code}

Once the WAR has been created you should follow the instructions that relate to the container which you are using to complete deployment
